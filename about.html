        <p>Kate Reid grew up in Melbourne, Australia, where a childhood marked by severe asthma didn’t stop her from developing big dreams. At just 13, after attending the Australian Grand Prix, she decided she wanted to work in Formula 1. She pursued this ambition with determination, studying Aerospace Engineering at RMIT University and eventually joining the Williams Formula One Team in the UK as an aerodynamicist. But the intense pressure, isolation, and relentless pace of elite motorsport took a heavy toll. By her late twenties, Reid was battling depression and a severe eating disorder, ultimately stepping away from the career she once believed was her dream.</p>

        <p> Searching for a new beginning, Reid traveled to Paris, where she completed a short but transformative training at the renowned bakery Du Pain et des Idées. There she discovered the precision, discipline, and tactile beauty of French pastry — a craft that spoke to both her engineering brain and her need for personal healing. Inspired, she returned to Melbourne determined to create the perfect croissant, approaching pastry with the same scientific focus she once applied to aerodynamics.</p>

          In 2012, she founded Lune Croissanterie, first as a modest wholesale operation. Within a few years, helped by her brother Cameron, Lune became a phenomenon: long queues, cult-level popularity, and international headlines. In 2016, The New York Times declared that her croissants “may be the finest you will find anywhere in the world.” Today, Reid is celebrated globally — not only for perfecting the art of laminated pastry, but for transforming her life with courage, discipline, and creativity. Her journey from Formula 1 engineer to world-renowned pastry chef continues to inspire, proving that sometimes the most unexpected pivots lead to the most extraordinary destinations.
